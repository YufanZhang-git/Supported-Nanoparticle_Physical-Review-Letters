1. KPOINTS
Because all the supported NP systems are very large, so the KPOINTS all assume the Gamma point.
The POSCAR files for the supported NP of various NP coverage can be found the the folder of "python script for generating structure/generated structure/"

2. INCAR_SCF
The INCAR file for self-consistent field calculations for supported NP (15% coverage)

3. INCAR_SR
The INCAR file for rough structural relaxation for supported NP (15% coverage)
